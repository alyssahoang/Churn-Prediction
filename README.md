•	The objective was to build a predictive model to forecast customer churn based on historical customer data and behavioral patterns.

•	Employed machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, SMOTEENN, decision trees, random forests, and Gradient Boosting Classifiers for predictive modeling. Demonstrated expertise in feature engineering, model evaluation, and tuning.

•	Developed a robust churn prediction model with an accuracy of 97% and an F1-score of 97%, enabling proactive retention strategies and reducing customer attrition.
